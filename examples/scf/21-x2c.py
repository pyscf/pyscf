'''
Applying scalar relativistic effects by decorating the scf object with
.x2c method.

Similar to the density fitting decoration, the relativistic effects can also
be applied without affecting the existed scf object.

mol = gto.M(
    verbose = 0,
    atom = '''8  0  0.     0
              1  0  -0.757 0.587
              1  0  0.757  0.587''',

mf = scf.RHF(mol).x2c().run()
print('E = %.12f, ref = -76.075429084850' % mf.e_tot)


mol.spin = 1
mol.charge = 1
mol.build(0, 0)

# .x2c1e is the same to the .x2c method in the current implementation
mf = scf.UKS(mol).x2c1e()
energy = mf.kernel()
print('E = %.12f, ref = -75.439160951099' % energy)

# Switch off x2c
mf.with_x2c = False
energy = mf.kernel()
print('E = %.12f, ref = %.12f' % (energy, scf.UKS(mol).kernel()))

# Note, applying the x2c method for GHF/GKS classes results in a calculation
# with the two-component relativistic Hamiltonian (including the spin-orbit
# coupling effects). Although solving in spherical GTO bases, the results in
# theory are equivalent to the X2C methods computed in the spinor bases.
# See relevant examples in examples/x2c/03-x2c_ghf.py
