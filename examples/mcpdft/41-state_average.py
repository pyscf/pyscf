'''
State average over states of different spins and/or spatial symmetry

In MC-PDFT, you must use the method attribute rather than the function:

NO  : mc = mcscf.state_average_mix (mc, [solver1, solver2], weights)
NO  : mcscf.state_average_mix_(mc, [solver1, solver2], weights)
YES : mc = mc.state_average_mix ([solver1, solver2], weights)
YES : mc.state_average_mix_([solver1, solver2], weights)
