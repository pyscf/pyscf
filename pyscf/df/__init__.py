Density fitting
===============

This module provides the fundamental functions to handle the 3-index tensors
(including the 3-center 2-electron AO and MO integrals, the Cholesky
decomposed integrals) required by the density fitting method or the RI
(resolution of identity) approximation.

Simple usage::

    >>> from pyscf import gto, dft
    >>> mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1', basis='ccpvdz')
    >>> mf = dft.RKS(mol).density_fit().run()
