Molecular Dynamics
==================

Simple usage::

    >>> from pyscf import gto, dft
    >>> import pyscf.md as md
    >>> mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1', basis='def2-tzvp')
    >>> mf = dft.RKS(mol)
    >>> mf.xc = 'pbe,pbe'
    >>> integrator = md.NVE(mf, dt=5, time=10).run()
'''

import numpy as np

# Grabs the global SEED variable and creates the random number generator
