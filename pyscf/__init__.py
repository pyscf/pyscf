How to use
----------
There are two ways to access the documentation: the docstrings come with
the code, and an online program reference, available from
http://www.pyscf.org

We recommend the enhanced Python interpreter `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_
and the web-based Python IDE `Ipython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_
to try out the package::

    >>> import pyscf
    >>> mol = pyscf.M(atom='H 0 0 0; H 0 0 1.2', basis='cc-pvdz')
    >>> mol.RHF().run()
    converged SCF energy = -1.06111199785749
    -1.06111199786
